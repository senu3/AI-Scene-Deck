# Vault / Asset Guide

**目的**: Vault と asset 管理の不変条件を定義する。
**適用範囲**: `vault/assets`, `.index.json`, `.metadata.json`, `.trash`。
**関連ファイル**: `src/utils/assetPath.ts`, `electron/vaultGateway.ts`, `src/components/AssetPanel.tsx`。

This note defines the Vault and asset management rules that ensure recovery. Cut-related flows are included only where they automatically create or register assets.

## Core Goal (Recovery)
JSON + Vault must be enough to restore:
- Story order
- Cut durations
- Adopted assets (which files are used)

## Canonical Asset Rules
- All assets live in `vault/assets/` and are named by hash (e.g. `img_abc123.png`, `vid_abc123.mp4`).
- `assets/.index.json` is the canonical index and must always be updated.
- `assetId -> filename` mapping is always stored in `.index.json` (even for duplicates).
- `originalPath` is vault-relative (relative to vault root), not absolute.

## `.index.json` (Asset Index)
Each entry stores:
- `id` (assetId)
- `filename` (hash-based name)
- `originalName`
- `originalPath` (vault-relative path)
- `hash`, `type`, `fileSize`, `importedAt`
- `usageRefs`: scene/cut usage for recovery
- `sceneId`, `sceneName`, `sceneOrder`
- `cutId`, `cutOrder`, `cutIndex` (1-based)

## `.metadata.json` (Scene Metadata + Attachments)
Used for information that is not a core asset index:
- Asset attachments (audio, offsets, analysis)
- Scene metadata: name + notes

## `.trash/.trash.json` (Trash Log)
When assets are deleted or rehashed:
- The file is moved to `.trash/`
- A record is added to `.trash/.trash.json`:
- `deletedAt`, `assetId`, `originalPath` (vault-relative), `trashRelativePath`
- `originRefs` (scene/cut) and `reason`
- Optional snapshot of the asset index entry
- Retention: items older than the retention period are purged.

## Asset Creation / Registration Paths
All paths must end with `.index.json` being updated via VaultGateway.

### 1) Cut Creation (Timeline / Drag & Drop)
- External file drop or sidebar asset add:
- Import file into `vault/assets/` (hash name)
- Read metadata + thumbnail
- Create Cut with `assetId`
- Update `.index.json` via VaultGateway

### 2) Attach Audio
- Attaching audio creates or registers an audio asset:
- Audio file is imported into `vault/assets/`
- `.metadata.json` stores attachment links and offset
- `.index.json` stores the audio asset entry via VaultGateway
- Audio assets are attachment-only and do not become cuts on the timeline.

### 3) Video Capture (Frame Capture)
- Captured frames are saved into `vault/assets/`, then re-imported for hash naming.
- The resulting asset is indexed via VaultGateway and a Cut is created below the source cut.

### 4) Clip Export (Finalize Clip)
- Exported clip is saved to `vault/assets/`, then re-imported for hash naming.
- The resulting asset is indexed via VaultGateway and a Cut is created.

## VaultGateway (Single Write Entry)
VaultGateway is the only writer for `.index.json` and `.trash/.trash.json`.
Renderer code must call `window.electronAPI.vaultGateway.*` for:
- Import + register (hash naming + index update)
- Index save (ordering + usageRefs update)
- Trash move (trash file + trash index + index removal)

## Performance Notes
- Hash calculation for vault import uses streaming SHA-256 in the main process (`createReadStream`), not full-file in-memory reads.
- `createCutFromImport` does not refresh all source folders per imported item; bulk drop flows should avoid per-file folder rescans.

## Recovery Priority
1. `project.sdp` for story order and cuts
2. `.index.json` for assetId -> file mapping + usageRefs
3. `.metadata.json` for scene notes/labels and asset attachments
4. `.trash/.trash.json` for audit/history
